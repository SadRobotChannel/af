Some sites look more trustworthy than others. Usually it's the simplicity of the site and the transparency of the information offered by the site owners. The <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bitnyx" target="_blank">Btnyx</a> is such a site.

The site has just two features and both of them are well implemented:
1. The main faucet page, allowing you to claim up to 30 satoshi every 30 minutes.
2. A natural ranking of the people who claimed the most per week, and a weekly price of 0.00100000 BTC to the winner.

This is how it looks. The <i>Faucet</i> page is essentially a grid of ads, with a Faucet button in the middle. With one click you claim your reward, and then wait 30 minutes to click again. And so on. No tricks, no pop-ups.
