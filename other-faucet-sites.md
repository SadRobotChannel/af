**One day on the front page... Maybe**

Here are several sites that we're aware of, however were not convinced they are good enough to be listed on the front page:

◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/www-clix-space" target="_blank">clix.space</a> a daily 0.01$ faucet...The site is not intuitive, and the pop-ups are annoying. You're welcome to try it for yourself.
<p> </p>
◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bitgames" target="_blank">bitgames</a> requires you to combine your faucet claims with completing offers on the Offer Wall, i.e. you cannot claim free faucet without performing offer wall tasks. If you're OK with this, the faucet is fairly good.
<p> </p>
◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/www-cryptomininggame" target="_blank">cryptomininggame</a> is a lot like febbit, but more complicated. You need to get used to the pop-ups which are constant when you <i>get energy</i> or <i>do missions</i> - the activities that are necessary to level up. A leveled miner can generate a reasonable amount of satoshi. We'll feature this game on the front page soon.
<p> </p>
◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/www-blackminer" target="_blank">blackminer</a> looks promising. A new facet run by an energetic team, you can claim XUN (UltraNote) coin, and BCN (Bytecoin). The team is adding more coins soon! Btw, a the faucet pays 100% referral commissions.
<p> </p>
◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/bitcoin-monsters" target="_blank">bitcoin-monsters</a> is indeed a fun game where you can level up your monsters (improve their abilities) and send them off to fight matches with other people's monsters. The leveling of monsters, however, is a tedious process where you need to essentially do a lot of ad clicking. If you're able to handle this, you can create a strong monster who can win a lot of matches.
<p> </p>
◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/satoshilabs" target="_blank">satoshilabs</a> is yet another crypto faucet game. Graphics seem attractive, but I could not get into it... Perhaps I was doing it wrong, so if you want to write a page on this game and use your Ref ID, please be my guest! Message <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoPayoff" target="_blank">me.</a>
