**One day... Maybe**

Here are several sites that we're aware of, however were not convinced they are good enough to be listed on the front page:

◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/www-clix-space" target="_blank">clix.space</a> a daily 0.01$ faucet...The site is not intuitive, and the pop-ups are annoying.
<p> </p>
◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bitgames" target="_blank">bitgames</a> requires you to combine your faucet claims with completing offers on the Offer Wall, i.e. you cannot claim free faucet without performing offer wall tasks.
<p> </p>
◘ <a href="http://bit.ly/www-cryptomininggame" target="_blank">cryptomininggame</a> is a lot like febbit, but much busier on the eyes. The pop-ups and short links don't help either. Potentially when you level-up your miner you can have a reasonable amount of satoshi per hour, but not at the low levels.
