If you're looking for websites similar to freebitco.in check out <a href="http://bit.ly/www-trustbtcfaucet" target="_blank">TrustBTCFaucet</a>. The site had copied a lot of good features from the classic freebitco.in, adapting some of them and adding several new ones.

As you register you'll see <i>Earn</i> on the top menu, and <i>Freebitcoin</i> sub-menu. That will take you to the faucet, which you can claim continuously every 5 minutes. The amount you win varies greatly, and you can get anywhere from 3 to 888 satoshi per roll.

An important feature of freebitco.in that people often neglect is the daily compound interest the site pays you after you store a certain amount of BTC on your account, thus encouraging you not to withdraw the funds. The freebitco.in asks for a minimum of 30,000 satoshi (0.00030000 BTC) and awards you with 4.08% annual interest. The TrustBTCFaucet has the same minimum amount and pays 4.24%.

A feature different from freebitco.in is TrustBTCFaucet's <i>Loyalty Bonus</i>. You see it under the same <i>Earn</i> menu. Use the wheel daily to get additional boost to your faucet claims of free goodies such as raffle tickets or more satoshi. Press Santa to spin!
