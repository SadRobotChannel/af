If you're looking for websites similar to freebitco.in check out <a href="http://bit.ly/www-trustbtcfaucet" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/trustbtcfaucet.com-thumb.png" alt="TrustBTCFaucet"/></a>. The site had copied a lot of good features from the classic freebitco.in, adapting some of them and adding several new ones.

As you register you'll see <i>Earn</i> on the top menu, and <i>Freebitcoin</i> sub-menu. That will take you to the faucet, which you can claim continuously every 5 minutes. The amount you win varies greatly, and you can get anywhere from 3 to 888 satoshi per roll.
