  <b>10 Satoshi every 5 minutes - bitcoinsfor.me faucet</b>
  <p> </p>
  Out of many faucet sites, <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bitcoinsfor-me" target="_blank">bitcoinsfor.me</a> stands out for its consistency and simplicity.
  <p> </p>
  While you can complete tasks within siteâ€™s <i>Offer Wall</i>, the simplest feature of the site is its faucet. When you start a new account and do not yet have any power-ups, you are allowed to claim every 5 minutes for up to 40 times per day. The menu says <i>Faucet Ready!</i> after the 5 minutes pass and you can click the menu to claim your reward.
  <p> </p>
  Each claim earns you 10 satoshi consistently, thus resulting in a 0.00000400 BTC reward per day. Note, this is exclusively from the faucet claiming and does not include rewards from any other tasks or games that you could complete. Anything you do in addition will increase your payoff even more.
  <p> </p>
  For example, there's a free Slots Roll you can do hourly. With some luck you can roll 10, 50, 100 or even several thousands of satoshi, which is added to your account.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  The bitcoinsfor.me is offers two options to withdraw the money you earn: 1) to your coinbase account and 2) to your faucethub.io account. You can change the settings here: <a href="https://bitcoinsfor.me/set_payment_method.php" target="_blank">https://bitcoinsfor.me/set_payment_method.php</a>
  <p> </p>
  The withdrawal minimum? A very reasonable amount of 0.00000500 BTC, which you could send directly to your coinbase.com email address on a weekly basis. Important, you do not put your BTC wallet address but rather email address of your coinbase.com account in the <i>payment method</i> settings. This way you completely avoid miner/transfer/withdrawal fees.

  <b>Sato - An amazing faucet you need to try</b>
  <p> </p>
  The <a href="http://bit.ly/sato-host" target="_blank">sato.host</a> is a simple and a minimalistic faucet. You are not required to register with your email account, but rather you log into the site with your wallet address. Please note that you need to use a bitcoin wallet address that you generate in your <a href="http://bit.ly/www-faucethub" target="_blank">FaucetHub</a> account.
  <p> </p>
  When you arrive to the site you'll need to wait 10 seconds for the login button to appear, as shown on screenshot below.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  Similarly, after you log in and complete captcha, you will need to wait for 10 second for the claim button to appear.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  The sato faucet changes its payout scheme often. Several weeks ago it was paying 100 satoshi every hour. Now, as you see from the screenshot, it allows you to claim with 0 min interval (claim after claim, no wait) and pays you 20 satoshi, but you can only 7 times per day. Tomorrow the payout scheme may be different again.
  <p> </p>
  The withdrawal is automatic. The amount you earn in sato is withdrawn and deposited every-time you claim. There's no minimum. As mentioned, you must claim into your FaucetHub account only, since both of these sites are "linked" together.

  <b>Do you like simplicity? Try Bitnyx.</b>
  <p> </p>
  Some sites look more trustworthy than others. Usually it's the simplicity of the site and the transparency of the information offered by the site owners. The <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bitnyx" target="_blank">Bitnyx</a> is such a site.
  <p> </p>
  The site has just two features and both of them are well implemented:<br>
  1. The main faucet page, allowing you to claim up to 30 satoshi every 30 minutes.<br>
  2. A natural ranking of the people who claimed the most per week, and a weekly price of 0.00100000 BTC to the winner.<br>
  <p> </p>
  This is how it looks. The <i>Faucet</i> page is essentially a grid of ads, with a Faucet button in the middle.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  With one click you claim your reward, and then wait 30 minutes to click again. And so on. No tricks, no pop-ups.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  Speaking of transparency, see image below. On the right are the amounts the active users manage to claim per week. You can see the range is about 0.00005000 - 0.00005700 BTC per week. Remember that the top person also receives a bonus of 0.00100000 BTC! On the left you can see some top withdrawals with very decent amounts.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  As with most of the faucet sites, you're also able to make money referring people, which is a hard a but rewarding task!

  <b>Freebitco.in - the most important faucet of them all</b>
  <p> </p>
  The <a href="http://bit.ly/www-freebitcoin" target="_blank">freebitco.in</a> is one of the oldest faucet sites. It is  intuitive in usage and its reputation had been tested by time and thousands of users.
  <p> </p>
  Once you register an account you can choose to secure it with 2FA. If you're not familiar with two-factor authentication or do not think it is necessary to have such an increased security you can skip this process. All you need is to ensure that you have an email and a password created (you can use passwordsgenerator.net to generate a strong and unique password), and then you can start claiming your hourly faucet rewards. The top menu, as shown on the screenshot below, indicates the faucet with the <i>FREE BTC</i> menu item. Click it.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  This screenshot shows also that the site offers several other services. Here we'll only cover the faucet (i.e.<i>FREE BTC</i>) and the <i>EARN BTC</i>.
  <p> </p>
  The site allows you to earn bitcoin via a daily interest of the total amount hold in your account. You start earning the interest when you reach 30,000 satoshi (0.0003 BTC), and we do recommend using this option. Either deposit this amount when you open an account with freebitco.in or claim the hourly faucet and do not withdraw. Here's the actual daily interest earning from our account:
  <p> </p>
  <img src="http://www.all-faucets.com/assets/images/freebitco.in-02.png" border="0">
  <p> </p>
  The daily interest is slowly increasing your total balance, which in turn increases the amounts of the daily interest payments. Note as we went from 107 to 108 satoshi on Feb 8. The best thing - you do not have to do anything at all for this to happen - it is automated.
  <p> </p>
  A word of caution, however. There are many sites that offer an interest on the BTC, asking you to deposition various amounts. Many, if not most, are very risky or scam sites, and there's no guarantee that you'll ever see your money back after you deposit with such sites. The freebitco.in is the only "compound interest" site we trust.
