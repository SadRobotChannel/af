  <b>10 Satoshi every 5 minutes - bitcoinsfor.me faucet</b>
  <p> </p>
  Out of many faucet sites, <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bitcoinsfor-me" target="_blank">bitcoinsfor.me</a> stands out for its consistency and simplicity.
  <p> </p>
  While you can complete tasks within siteâ€™s <i>Offer Wall</i>, the simplest feature of the site is its faucet. When you start a new account and do not yet have any power-ups, you are allowed to claim every 5 minutes for up to 40 times per day. The menu says <i>Faucet Ready!</i> after the 5 minutes pass and you can click the menu to claim your reward.
  <p> </p>
  Each claim earns you 10 satoshi consistently, thus resulting in a 0.00000400 BTC reward per day. Note, this is exclusively from the faucet claiming and does not include rewards from any other tasks or games that you could complete. Anything you do in addition will increase your payoff even more.
  <p> </p>
  For example, there's a free Slots Roll you can do hourly. With some luck you can roll 10, 50, 100 or even several thousands of satoshi, which is added to your account.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  The bitcoinsfor.me is offers two options to withdraw the money you earn: 1) to your coinbase account and 2) to your faucethub.io account. You can change the settings here: <a href="https://bitcoinsfor.me/set_payment_method.php" target="_blank">https://bitcoinsfor.me/set_payment_method.php</a>
  <p> </p>
  The withdrawal minimum? A very reasonable amount of 0.00000500 BTC, which you could send directly to your coinbase.com email address on a weekly basis. Important, you do not put your BTC wallet address but rather email address of your coinbase.com account in the <i>payment method</i> settings. This way you completely avoid miner/transfer/withdrawal fees.

  <b>Sato - An amazing faucet you need to try</b>
  <p> </p>
  The <a href="http://bit.ly/sato-host" target="_blank">sato.host</a> is a simple and a minimalistic faucet. You are not required to register with your email account, but rather you log into the site with your wallet address. Please note that you need to use a bitcoin wallet address that you generate in your <a href="http://bit.ly/www-faucethub" target="_blank">FaucetHub</a> account.
  <p> </p>
  When you arrive to the site you'll need to wait 10 seconds for the login button to appear, as shown on screenshot below.

  Similarly, after you log in and complete captcha, you will need to wait for 10 second for the claim button to appear.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  The sato faucet changes its payout scheme often. Several weeks ago it was paying 100 satoshi every hour. Now, as you see from the screenshot, it allows you to claim with 0 min interval (claim after claim, no wait) and pays you 20 satoshi, but you can only 7 times per day. Tomorrow the payout scheme may be different again.
  <p> </p>
  The withdrawal is automatic. The amount you earn in sato is withdrawn and deposited every-time you claim. There's no minimum. As mentioned, you must claim into your FaucetHub account only, since both of these sites are "linked" together.

  <b>Do you like simplicity? Try Bitnyx.</b>
  <p> </p>
  Some sites look more trustworthy than others. Usually it's the simplicity of the site and the transparency of the information offered by the site owners. The <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bitnyx" target="_blank">Bitnyx</a> is such a site.
  <p> </p>
  The site has just two features and both of them are well implemented:<br>
  1. The main faucet page, allowing you to claim up to 30 satoshi every 30 minutes.<br>
  2. A natural ranking of the people who claimed the most per week, and a weekly price of 0.00100000 BTC to the winner.<br>
  <p> </p>
  This is how it looks. The <i>Faucet</i> page is essentially a grid of ads, with a Faucet button in the middle.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  With one click you claim your reward, and then wait 30 minutes to click again. And so on. No tricks, no pop-ups.
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  Speaking of transparency, see image below. On the right are the amounts the active users manage to claim per week. You can see the range is about 0.00005000 - 0.00005700 BTC per week. Remember that the top person also receives a bonus of 0.00100000 BTC! On the left you can see some top withdrawals with very decent amounts.

  As with most of the faucet sites, you're also able to make money referring people, which is a hard a but rewarding task!
