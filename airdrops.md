A follower on Twitter had asked for a way to get started with Airdrops, and so I put a few screenshots together. Here's how I got started with crypto airdrops.

<p> </p>
**Follow @etherflyercom**

There are certainly a lot of individuals or parties you distribute tokens, but my personal experience had started by following the <a href="https://twitter.com/etherflyercom" target="_blank">EtherFlyer</a> Twitter account. What you'll see from them are post as such:

It is not enough just to re-tweet this post to get your share of the distribution. There are a number of steps, but first you'll need to set-up an account at <a href="https://www.etherflyer.com/" target="_blank">www.etherflyer.com</a>.

**Generate your Ethereum (ETH) wallet**

When registering at etherflyer.com you will be prompted to generate your Ethereum wallet. Pay close attention to the instructions, as it may be confusing to set up the Mnemonic Phrase if you've never done that before. Once you finish the account set-up, your dashboard should look like this:

Two things to note - 1) your newly generated ETH wallet address, which you'll need to copy and paste when entering airdrops, and 2) the menu item <i>Airdrop</i> on the etherflyer.com website. This is where scheduled events are listed:

**View Details**

Look into the details for each of the airdrops. Most of these events are looking to raise as much awareness as possible, so the tasks that you'll need to complete  usually involve retweeting the events and such. It is fairly fast and easy, since there are apps and sites that help your sharing activities. They also track how much sharing you do and award you various amount of <i>Entry</i> points. Click the <i>Airdrop Link</i> to proceed.

You'll arrive to either rafflecopter.com or gleam.io or another similar site that does giveaways and raffles. This is where you'll paste your ETH wallet address that you created earlier.

This is also where you follow the request of the giveaway, such as following the token's team, retweeting, etc. Click away on as many items as you can to increase your entry points. On the screenshot below I completed two tasks and got 6 entry points. Each entry point will translate to a number of tokens that I will receive at the Airdrop date specified in the details section.

**All set**

All you have to do now is just wait. Monitor your www.etherflyer.com account during the next days and you'll see the new tokens in the <i>My Assets</i> section of the website. Once you have the tokens, you can keep them or trade them. But that will be a topic for another post!
