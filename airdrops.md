**Follow @etherflyercom**

There are certainly a lot of individuals or parties you distribute tokens via the airdrops, but my personal experience with getting a number of different tokens was by following the <a href="https://twitter.com/etherflyercom" target="_blank">EtherFlyer</a> Twitter account.

It is not enough just to re-tweet this post to get your share of the distribution. First, you'll need to set-up an account at <a href="https://www.etherflyer.com/" target="_blank">www.etherflyer.com</a>.

**Generate your Ethereum (ETH) wallet**

When registering at etherflyer.com you will be prompted to generate your Ethereum wallet. Pay close attention to the instructions, as it may be confusing to set up the Mnemonic Phrase if you've never done that before. Once you finish the account set-up, your dashboard should look like this:
