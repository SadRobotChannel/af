The <a href="http://bit.ly/sato-host" target="_blank">sato.host</a> is one of the simplest and minimalistic faucets. You are not required to register with your email account, but rather you log into the site with your wallet address. Please note that you need to use a bitcoin wallet address that you generate in your <a href="http://bit.ly/www-faucethub" target="_blank">faucethub</a> account.

When you arrive to the page you'll need to wait 10 seconds for the Login button to appear, as shown on screenshot below.

Similarly, after you log in, you will be asked to complete captcha and you will need to wait 10 second for the claim button to appear.

The sato faucet changes its payout scheme often. Several weeks ago it was paying 100 satoshi every hour. Now, as you see from screenshot below, it allows you to claim with 0 internal (claim after claim after claim) and pays you 20 satoshi, but you can only 7 times per day. Tomorrow the payout scheme may be different again.
