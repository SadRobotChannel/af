</p>
On Sunday, May 31st we will randomly select 1 person who will receive 10,000 Satoshi!

**Details**

1. The random selection will be done via a twren.ch. We have already done one giveaway with twren and it was super effective and fair. Link: <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoPayoff/status/1091053109185601537" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/CryptoPayoff/status/1091053109185601537</a>
2. The winner will be selected and announced on Sunday, May 31st directly on Twitter. The winner will DM us her or his wallet address to receive bitcoin.
3. The 10,000 Satoshi will be transferred to the winner's wallet on the same day!

**Notes**

- If possible, we prefer <a href="http://bit.ly/www-coinbase" target="_blank">Coinbase</a> account email address instead of your bitcoin wallet address, since that would avoid unnecessary miner fees. Coinbase, however, is not a pre-requisite and any bitcoin wallet address will be accepted!

**...Also**

There's another contest going on in March - a <a href="/march-article-contest.html">Faucet Article Contest</a>. You can submit your article about your Top 5 favorite faucets. The Top 5 articles will be selected and published. When referencing your Top 5 favorites, you can use your referral IDs for each faucet, thus driving new signing and increasing your earnings! <a href="/march-article-contest.html">Read more</a> about the Faucet Article Contest on 1st of March.
