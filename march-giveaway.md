2. The winner will be selected and announced on Sunday, May 31st directly on Twitter. The winner will DM us her or his wallet.
3. The 10,000 Satoshi will be transferred to the winner's wallet on the same day!

**Notes**

- If possible, we prefer <a href="http://bit.ly/www-coinbase" target="_blank">Coinbase</a> account email address instead of your bitcoin wallet address, since that would avoid unnecessary miner fees. Coinbase, however, is not a pre-requisite and any bitcoin wallet address will be accepted!
