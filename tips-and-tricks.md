**1. Creating Secure Accounts**

Because some sites and services are interconnected it is recommended that you use the same email address when registering accounts on different faucet websites. For instance, some faucet websites are "interconnected" with faucethub or coinpot. 

However, you should never use the same password.

Go for randomly generated passwords when registering, such as the ones offered by passwordsgenerator.net and never re-use the same password on different websites.
