**February, 2019**

February 9th marks the birthday of our site, and this monthly blog we summarizes the first 3 weeks of site's operations.

First, a bit about the principles behind the site. Our goal is to share information that we ourselves found to be useful. The site is meant for visitors with various experience in digital currency and crypto faucets, equally useful to the beginners and those of you with some experience.
 
The beginners to crypto faucets will benefit by reading the <a href="/index.html">main page</a> which lists over 10 popular faucets with additional intro to each category and detailed information in the discussion pages for each of the listed faucets. We're looking for your interaction, and most of the pages are enabled with the commenting feature from Disqus. Comment with your questions, opinions, or actual experience, if you believe your comments can be useful to other visitors. The site's main webmaster is CP, and he is happy to talk to you live <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/CryptoPayoff">via Twitter</a> or in our <a href="/chat.html">chat</a>. You can also send us an email at <i>cryptopayoff@gmail.com</i> address.

The experienced users will benefit by jumping directly to the <a href="/all/index.html">all faucets</a> list. The list contains hand-picked faucets sites which correspond to our standard of quality and value. We are using all the faucets sites that we list on www.all-faucets.com ourselves, and if we find an issue with any of the faucets, we remove them from our list.

Finally, there's a unique services that we offer to our Patrons. With a monthly subscription to one of several <a target="_blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/CryptoPayoff">packages we provide via Patreon.com</a>, you can receive an amount of BTC ranging from 10,000 to 1,000,000 satoshi (฿) per month. This is a service we created for your convenience - you do not have to do anything during the month (asides of subscribing just once) to receive the your monthly digital currency, and you can cancel your subscription to the packages at any moment. Our rates are very competitive, and we encourage you to search Internet for similar services and compare our offer with other offers on the Internet.
