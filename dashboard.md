**What is YOUR 'claim dashboard'?**

What we try to achieve here is to create a page that you could bookmark and use daily for claiming. There are several ideas we're experimenting with, but finally it is up to you, the user, to tell us what kind of a dashboard would be useful to you!
<p> </p>
Here's a very short survey we'd like to ask you to take. How many times do you claim per day? Do you use your smart phone or computer only? Please take 2 minutes to respond to this survey so we can build a better service for you.
