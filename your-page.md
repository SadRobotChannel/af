**Become a contributor. Own a page.**

As you have noticed, some pages are administered by different people and we'd love to involve YOU! You can own an existing page for a faucet and use your reference ID with the link on both 1) our main page (the table with all faucets) and 2) the individual page you'll own.

The cost of ownership is $1/month, and you can subscribe via <a href="https://www.patreon.com/join/CryptoPayoff?" target="_blank">Patreon</a> or <a href="https://tippin.me/@CryptoPayoff" target="_blank">tippin.me</a>. Message <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoPayoff" target="_blank">@CryptoPayoff</a> to get started today!

**The Rules**

We like to keep our site clean and easy-on-the-eyes. And so a few rules are important to maintain so that different authors still contribute in a uniform way.

- Your page can contain only one referral ID, following the practice of one page per faucets
- You are welcome to own a <i>Discussion</i> page, but other types of pages are welcome too; We can discuss this!
- We welcome one ad unit on your page, which will be from your <a target="_blank" href='http://bit.ly/www-a-ads'>a-ads</a> account. The size and placement of the ad unit can be discussed.

Violating of the rules will result in a warning, and a possible termination of our mutual agreement.
