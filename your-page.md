**Become a contributor. Own a page.**

As you have noticed, some pages are administered by different people. We are to involve you for free. If you see that we've missed a good faucet, you can add a page for the faucet and administer it, including your ref ID for the faucet, provide description, screenshots and answer visitors questions.

Our system is simple. You have 1 free credit per month, which you can use to add 1 page / 1 faucet site.
Once you place your page online, it is yours for 6 months, after which it expires and you need to either renew it, or the rights of the page will go to someone else.

If you want to add more than 1 page per month, you can pay $5 per page. The expiration for the paid pages is the same - 6 months.

<br>If email is not your thing, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoPayoff" target="_blank">message @CryptoPayoff</a> to get started today.
