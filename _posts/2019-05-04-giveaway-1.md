<b>Enjoy these 10 Star Wars facts you may not have known!</b>

<i>What was Star Wars originally called?</i>

The film was originally released as—and consequently often called—Star Wars, without Episode IV or the subtitle A New Hope. The 1980 sequel, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, featured the episode number and subtitle in the opening crawl.

<i>Who is Yoda?</i>

Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master and stronger than most in his connection with the Force. Small in size but wise and powerful, he trained Jedi for over 800 years, playing integral roles in the Clone Wars, the instruction of Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.

<i>Why did Star Wars start on 4?</i>

The short answer is that it didn't. George Lucas didn't really have a planned out storyline when he sat down to write Star Wars. ... So Star Wars 2 was renamed to Star Wars Episode V: The Epire Strikes Back and Star Wars was later rereleased in theaters under the name Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.

<i>Why is Star Wars called A New Hope?</i>

When Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope originally hit theaters in 1977, it was simply called Star Wars. It wasn't until the film's theatrical re-release in 1981 that it received the Episode IV marking and the subtitle A New Hope. <a href="http://screenprism.com/insights/article/was-star-wars-episode-iv-a-new-hope-originally-released-under-another-title" target="_blank">Source...</a>

<i>Are Sith stronger than Jedi?</i>

There are no Sith that are more powerful than a fully trained Jedi. NONE, ever. A fully trained Jedi Master is not able to be defeated by the sheer power of a Sith. ... Mace lost because he was Betrayed, not because Palpatine was more powerful, and Palpatine was the most powerful Sith there has ever been.

<i>What do color lightsabers mean?</i>

Around 4000 BBY, lightsaber crystals were used to indicate a Jedi's chosen class. Blue indicated a Jedi Guardian, a Jedi who used the Force on a more physical level. Green indicated a Jedi Consular, a Jedi who preferred to reflect on the mysteries of the Force and fight the dark side at its heart.
<a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Lightsaber_crystal" target="_blank">Source...</a>

Purple lightsaber crystals were coveted for their scarcity and widely accepted magnificence and beauty. The most notorious purple lightsaber wielder acquired his crystal on Hurikane, a Jedi by the name of Mace Windu. ... There were very few other galactic warriors outside of Windu which wielded the purple lightsaber.
