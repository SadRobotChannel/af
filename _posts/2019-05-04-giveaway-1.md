<b>Enjoy these 10 Star Wars facts you may not have known!</b>

<i>What was Star Wars originally called?</i>

The film was originally released as—and consequently often called—Star Wars, without Episode IV or the subtitle A New Hope. The 1980 sequel, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, featured the episode number and subtitle in the opening crawl.

<i>Who is Yoda?</i>

Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master and stronger than most in his connection with the Force. Small in size but wise and powerful, he trained Jedi for over 800 years, playing integral roles in the Clone Wars, the instruction of Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.

<i>Why did Star Wars start on 4?</i>

The short answer is that it didn't. George Lucas didn't really have a planned out storyline when he sat down to write Star Wars. ... So Star Wars 2 was renamed to Star Wars Episode V: The Epire Strikes Back and Star Wars was later rereleased in theaters under the name Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope.

<i>Why is Star Wars called A New Hope?</i>

When Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope originally hit theaters in 1977, it was simply called Star Wars. It wasn't until the film's theatrical re-release in 1981 that it received the Episode IV marking and the subtitle A New Hope. The reason is pretty simple
