<b>Enjoy these 10 Star Wars facts you may not have known!</b>

1. What was Star Wars originally called?

The film was originally released as—and consequently often called—Star Wars, without Episode IV or the subtitle A New Hope. The 1980 sequel, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, featured the episode number and subtitle in the opening crawl.

2. Who is Yoda?

Yoda was a legendary Jedi Master and stronger than most in his connection with the Force. Small in size but wise and powerful, he trained Jedi for over 800 years, playing integral roles in the Clone Wars, the instruction of Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.
