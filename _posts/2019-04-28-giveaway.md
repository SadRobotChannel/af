     <h5><span>BTC Fox</span></h5>
     <a href="http://bit.ly/www-btcfox" target="_blank">btcfox.info</a> is a free bitcoin faucet and a  uniquely profitable bitcoin generator.
		 Some faucet sites allow you to earn an interest on the amounts you hold, motivating you not to withdraw your earned money. BTC Fox stands out because:<br>
		 1) the amounts of interest you receive is <i>much</i> higher than websites like <a href="http://bit.ly/www-freebitcoin" target="_blank">freebitco.in</a>, and<br>
		 2) there's no minimum balance that you need to maintain to earn interest - even 1 satoshi will generate bitcoin without your involvement.<br>
		 <p> </p>
		 Here's how freebitco.in (left) compares to btcfox.info (right) for interest generation on the amount of 30,000 satoshi:
