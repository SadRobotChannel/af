The <a href="http://bit.ly/www-freebitcoin" target="_blank">freebitco.in</a> is one of the oldest faucet sites. It is  intuitive in usage and its reputation had been tested by time and thousands of users.

Once you register an account you can choose to secure it with 2FA. If you're not familiar with two-factor authentication or do not think it is necessary to have such an increased security you can skip this process. All you need is to ensure that you have an email and a password created (see <a href="tips-and-tricks">tip #1</a>), and then you can start claiming your hourly faucet rewards. The top menu, as shown on the screenshot below, indicates the faucet with the <i>FREE BTC</i> menu item. Click it.

This screenshot shows also that the site offers several other services. Here we'll only cover the faucet (i.e.<i>FREE BTC</i>) and the <i>EARN BTC</i>.

The site allows you to earn bitcoin via a daily interest of the total amount hold in your account. You start earning the interest when you reach 30,000 satoshi (0.0003 BTC), and we do recommend using this option. Either deposit this amount when you open an account with freebitco.in or claim the hourly faucet and do not withdraw. Here's the actual daily interest earning from our account:

The daily interest is slowly increasing your total balance, which in turn increases the amounts of the daily interest payments. Note as we went from 107 to 108 satoshi on Feb 8. The best thing - you do not have to do anything at all for this to happen - it is automated.

A word of caution, however. There are many sites that offer an interest on the BTC, asking you to deposition various amounts. Many, if not most, are very risky or scam sites, and there's no guarantee that you'll ever see your money back after you deposit with such sites. The freebitco.in is the only "compound interest" site we trust.
