     <a href="http://bit.ly/www-lootbits" target="_blank">Lootbits</a> is a new and innovative faucet platform acting as a combination of games and rewards.
     <p> </p>
     Joining and playing is completely free. No deposits or payments are required and that is what separates them from gambling sites.
     <p> </p>
     You get rewarded by opening loot boxes. Each box has something interesting hidden inside. Sometimes it is xp points, more gems, collectible badges and other items. And the best part is that often you can find real Bitcoins which are immediately added to your balance!

     Even if you run out of gems required to open boxes, they give more for free every hour! Also, you can invite people, complete offers and play additional games to get even more gems and continue opening boxes until you reach your payout!
