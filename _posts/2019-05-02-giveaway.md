     <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bits-pays" target="_blank">Bits-Pays</a> is a high-paying reward site with several unique features.
		 Get satoshi for viewing three types of ads - InFrame ads, noFrame ads and Flash ads. Get as much as 100 satoshi for viewing a 60 second ad.
		 Additionally, sign-in every day to get a 100-300 satoshi Daily Bonus.
		 <p> </p>
		 The free membership includes a miner game, giving free satoshi as you level up (e.g. a miner of 20-lvl will mine about 15,000 satoshi per day),
		 although it will take some patience to level up your miner.
		 <p> </p>
 		 Uniquely, the website sells its own company shares. By buying Bits-Pays shares you own a part of the service and you receive a monthly dividend in a form of free satoshi.
	   The prices of shares increase on a monthly basis and you can trade them on the website's Shares Market.
