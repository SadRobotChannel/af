     <h5><span>RollerCoin - An online virtual bitcoin mining game</span></h5>
     One of the first online bitcoin mining simulator games is <a href="http://bit.ly/www-rollercoin" target="_blank">RollerCoin</a>.
		 Your virtual mining power depends on the scores you reach playing flash games such as match-three puzzle games.
		 The more you play the higher your virtual mining power. Want to earn passively? No problem, buy a virtual mining unit at the in-game shop.
		 One way or another you get real satoshi which you can continue to reinvest or withdraw!
