Out of many faucet sites <a href="http://bit.ly/www-bitcoinsfor-me" target="_blank">bitcoinsfor.me</a> stands out for its consistency and simplicity.

While you can complete tasks within site’s “Offer Walls”, the simplest feature of the site is its faucet. By default, that is just when you start a new account and do not have any power-ups, you are allowed to claim every 5 minutes for up to 40 times per day. Each claim earns you 10 satoshi, thus resulting in a 0.00000400 BTC reward per day. Note, this is exclusively from faucet claiming and is not including any other tasks or games that you could complete on the website. Anything you do in additional will increase your payoff even more.

For example, there's a free Slots Roll you can do hourly. With some luck you can roll 10, 50, 100 or even sveral thousands of satoshi, which is added to your account.
