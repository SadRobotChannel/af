Share the links to our site's <a href="http://www.all-faucets.com/all/index.html">Faucet Directory page</a> via social media and earn points. Each time you share your Rank is increasing. In the end of the month we will award the top 10 contributors!

<b>Your Reward for Sharing</b>
<p> </p>
The March will be beta run. We hope to have at least 10 people participating. As a reward for sharing, we will put <i>your</i> Ref IDs on the <a href="http://www.all-faucets.com/all/index.html">Faucet Directory page</a> . Your ranking number will indicate which faucet you'll get to own. Each person will own 5 sites, counting from the top, as follows:
<br>
Rank 1: sites #1 -5<br>
Rank 2: sites #6-10<br>
etc...
Rank 10: sites #50-55
<p> </p>

The winners in March will have their Ref IDs on the site until end of April. During April a new contest will be running, and new winners will be announced in the end of of April, who will in turn have their Ref IDs placed on the site in May, and so on. You can keep winning if you keep sharing!
