Each month we'll be running a referral program offering you a chance to participate. Sign up just once via form below and participate every month. Share our links on a monthly basis on social media. Each time you share a link you earn a point. In the end of the month we will award the top contributors!
<p>
The March will be beta run. We hope to have at least 10 people participating. As a reward for sharing, we will put <i>your</i> Ref IDs on the Faucet Directory listings. Your ranking will also indicate which faucet you'll get to own. Each person will own 5 sites, as follows:<p>
Rank 1: sites #1 -5<br>
Rank 2: sites #6-10<br>
etc...
