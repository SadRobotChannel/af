The <a href="http://bit.ly/www-freebitcoin" target="_blank">freebitco.in</a> is one of the oldest faucet sites. It is  intuitive in usage and its reputation had been tested by time and thousands of users.

Once you register an account you can choose to secure it with 2FA. If you're not familiar with two-factor authentication or do not think it is necessary to have such increased security you can skip this process. All you need is to ensure that you have an email and a password created, and then you can start claiming your hourly faucet reward. The top menu, as shown on the screenshot below, indicates faucet with the <i>FREE BTC</i> menu item. Click it.
